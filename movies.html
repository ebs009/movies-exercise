        <p>MovieCo has released some data about all of their rentals in 2014. As a competitor, your job is to go though the data and get some insigts about your competitor!</p>
        <p>Two questions are below, and we've retrieved the data for you... but it's probably not in the format you want. You'll have to go through and get the data to reveal the answers using your newfound skills with arrays, regex, and strings!</p>
